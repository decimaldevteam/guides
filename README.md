# Decimal Guides

A very basic and simple blog site for written documentation of youtube videos! You can view my channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu6B4Z62fiCT_mwwHlc84iQ)! Originally this website had some useless things, so i removed them and used next.js for backend and cache guides and its information! You can view this website [here](https://guides.decimaldev.xyz)! You can contribute this guides by putting the file in `guides/` folder! This uses the custom server app in `index.js` and custom api router in `api.js` because next.js loads the api page only on visit which gives us a backdraw so i needed to use it with express.js!
