# Steps

## GitHub Login

Login to your github account, then view up the [decimaldevteam/guides](https://github.com/decimaldevteam/guides) where you need to make a pull request!

## Making your guide

Your guide needs to be written in markdown which gets converted later when user views it! So for that you need to go to [/public/guides/](https://github.com/decimaldevteam/guides/tree/main/public/guides) where you will find all guides now to create your guide you need to select a name for example lets assume that your guide name is `Some Guide` then your filename should be `some-guide.md` because it will be the path `guides.decimaldev.xyz/#/guide/some-guide` so it will be easy for users!

## Paging your guide

You can make paging to your guide by adding **-****-****-** which is `<hr>` in html so if you want to add html then use `<hr>`, if you use **-****-****-** means the content after that line is next page!

## Configuring your guide

Now you need to configure your guide by adding details of your guide in [/public/api.json](https://github.com/decimaldevteam/guides/blob/main/public/api.json) where you will see something like this

```json
[
    {
        "name": "Add your guide",
        "description": "Add your guide to our site!",
        "thumbnail": "thumbnail",
        "file": "add-your-guide",
        "updated": "19/11/2020 10:56 PM IST",
        "top": true,
        "tags": [
            "decimal",
            "official"
        ],
        "contributors": [
            "Scientific-Guy"
        ],
        "sidebar": [...]
    },
    {
        ...
    },
]
```

This is the place where all details exists, you need to create a json object with the following objet structure!

- **name** - Name of the guide
- **description** - Description of the guide
- **thumbnail** - Thumbnail of the guide
- **contributors** - Array of github users
- **tags** - This will decide to what to display in recommended guides
- **file** - File name you selected like `some-guide.md` so just add `some-guide`!
- **sidebar** - Sidebar will be the array of the contents displayed in the main sidebar same to the index divided in the page!

Others are edited by the authors!

After doing your things, make a pull request which will be viewed and merged in few hours!
